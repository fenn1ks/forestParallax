            <p>
              The world of caves is an amazing world! The temperature does not
              change here all year round, there is eternal darkness and unbroken
              silence. Caves have always occupied an important place in human
              life. They gave our distant ancestors shelter and a relatively
              safe place for a family hearth. Many of the caves still keep
              traces of the presence of primitive man. And how many secrets and
              legends envelop the caves! The lack of information does not yet
              make it possible to find answers to many questions of interest to
              scientists. Caves as a unique object of nature constantly attract
              researchers. The first mentions of caves are already found in the
              writings of Herodotus, Strabo and Pausanias. ©
